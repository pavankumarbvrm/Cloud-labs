Here's a high-level overview of how you might set it up:

    Initial environment setup:

    Register your AWS Account
    Register your domain name
    Create AWS Key Pairs
    Create AWS Access Keys
    Setup Django Application
    Dockerize the django Application

2. GitHub Repository Setup:

    Create a GitHub repository for your Django application.
    Add your Django code to this repository.

3. Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions:

    Configure GitHub Actions workflows to run tests, linting, and other checks on every push or pull request.
    Utilize Docker containers for consistency across different environments.

4. Infrastructure Provisioning with Terraform:

    Define infrastructure requirements using Terraform.
    Provision necessary AWS resources (like EC2 instances, VPC, subnets, etc.) for the Jenkins server, Kubernetes cluster, and any other required services.

5. Continuous Deployment with Jenkins:

    Set up Jenkins on a server (can be an AWS EC2 instance).
    Configure Jenkins pipelines to:
    Automatically trigger on successful CI builds.
    Build Docker images for your Django application.
    Push these Docker images to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
    Deploy Docker images to Kubernetes clusters using Kubernetes plugin for Jenkins.

6. Kubernetes Orchestration:

    Set up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using tools like kops, EKS, or even Terraform itself.
    Deploy your Django application using Kubernetes manifests.
    Utilize Helm charts for managing complex deployments.

7. Continuous Delivery with ArgoCD:

    Install and configure ArgoCD on your Kubernetes cluster.
    Set up GitOps workflows by syncing Kubernetes manifests from a Git repository (where your Kubernetes manifests are stored).
    ArgoCD will continuously monitor the Git repository for changes and automatically apply them to the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring your application is always up-to-date.

8. Monitoring and Logging:

    Implement monitoring and logging solutions such as Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack to monitor the health and performance of your Django application and infrastructure.
    Add Slack Notification

9. Security Considerations:

    Implement security best practices throughout the pipeline, including secure storage of secrets and credentials, network security, and container security.

10. Setting Up Custom domain names for our Django Rest APIs

11. Integrate django APIs with AWS API Gateway with a custom domain

12. Documentation and Maintenance:

    Document the setup, configuration, and maintenance processes to ensure that the pipeline can be easily understood and maintained by your team.

This setup will provides you a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for your Django application using Jenkins , terraform and Kubernetes, from code commit to deployment, with automation at every step. However, keep in mind that setting up such a complex pipeline requires careful planning, configuration, and ongoing maintenance.
